            Nelson Mandela showed what is possible for our world and within each one of us - if we believe, dream and work together. Let us continue each day to be inspired by his lifelong example and his call to never cease working for a better and more just world.

          <p>We pay tribute to the world’s best known, most loved statesman and human rights icon, South Africa's most respected leader Nelson Mandela who passed away at the age of 95.
          </p>

          <br>
          <p>Many people have been inspired by the role of the former President of South Africa who was known by his clan name, Madiba. He was a peacemaker, philanthropist and activist for positive change. His name has become synonymous with the selfless struggle for liberty and democracy, the unwavering pursuit of equality and social injustice.</p>
          <br>
          <br>
          <p>One of his most famous quotes was: “What counts in life is not the mere fact that we have lived. It is what difference we have made in the lives of others that will determine the significance of the life we led.” By those terms, few can lay claim to having made a more significant contribution than this great man, a true legend.</p>
